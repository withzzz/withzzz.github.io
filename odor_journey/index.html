          how smell influences our communication and interactions with our lovers?<br>
          What is the gap between what we perceive and what our partner actually thinks about us?<br>

          <h3>Pt 1 : Scent Journal - Self Observation</h3>
          <p>A dairy about the impressive scents in my daily life. In the journal I record the reason I noticed the scent, the source where they were from, the experience and feeling had. By writing this journal, it became clearer that scent plays an important role in my life. Memories involving scent are more vivid in my mind. This self observation is a great inspiration of my research on others later on.<br>

          <h3>Pt 2 : Smelling Booth I - Scent Impression</h3>
          <p>An installation to set up a communication between people just by scent. The T-shirt providers present themselves by worn T-shirt with their body odor. The audiences build their impression on these T-shirt providers by smelling their T-shirt. It’s a challenge for both scent providers and observers. It turns out that people’s opinions and imagination on scent are based on their own personality and experience.<br>

          <h3>Pt 3 : Interview - Scent x Intimacy</h3>
          <p>A research focus on how scent affects the way we communicate and interact with our lover during a romantic relationship. During the interview, 5 couples participated and each of them shared their stories about scent. Many interesting things emerged from the interview such as people tend to think their partner smells better than they do, and each couple have their own collective memories and signature scent. Olfactory experience exists in every level of intimacy. Noticing the scent and talking about it with our lover is a way of showing trust and experiencing intimacy.<br>

          <h3>Pt 4 : Smelling Booth II - New York Scent Stories</h3>
          <p>A scent-audio installation that encourages people to discover the beauty of scent in a romantic relationship. Audiences are invited to immersed in the environment representing the scene from true stories and interact with the scent objects intimately. When get closer to the objects, audiences could listen to the audio of the couples telling their scent stories.<br>
